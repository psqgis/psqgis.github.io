Hello All,

Our next monthly meeting will be held Tuesday, September 8, from 6 pm - 8 pm at the Shoreline Library, 345 NE 175th Street, Shoreline, WA 98155.

The location is just a block or so east of the I-5 freeway intersection with NE 175th.

I'll be sending a followup message to you with an agenda.  If you have anything that you'd like to share with the group about QGIS (questions, tips, news, etc), please let me know.

I look forward to seeing you!

Stu
