Hello All!

Our monthly meeting will be held this coming Tuesday, Nov. 15, from 6-8 pm at the Lake Forest Bar and Grill.  We've met there before and everyone seemed to enjoy the location.

Our QGIS topics will be:

1. Using Geopackage and Spatialite data within QGIS (Evan was kind enough to offer to take the lead on this) and
2. Custom data input forms, part 2 by Andrew.

I look forward to seeing all of you!
